## Introduction

1. Test data set is in the 'data' folder and training set is removed.
2. The checkpoints for each model is in the 'model_zoo' folder. Please down the checkpoints
   from [model_zoo.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D_ESmqTxH5qwSk5ZBX6bYEBjoaC_qAin/view?usp=sharing) and unzip
   all the 'pth' files in 'model_zoo' folder.
3. The full experiment result is in the 'results' folder with different denoisers and different IR tasks.
4. The kernels used in deblurring and super-resolution task is stored in 'kernels' folder.
5. CNN denoiser and U-net denoiser are in 'models' folder.
6. Training dataset can be downloaded
   from [training dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/112G-hoEXEAFiO-splRE-J3a27OnHXLEo?usp=sharing)
